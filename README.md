# finalproject - Match Maker

This project is a web application that matches users for matches based on their gender, USTA level, and interest in singles or doubles. 
Groups of like two will be matched up for single matches and groups of like four will be matched up for doubles matches. 
These matches happen automatically upon login. Users can see their new matches, once opened, it becomes an existing match. 
In the match detail page, the duo or group can message each other and users can edit their own messages. 

Please run NPM install before running the application.

Due to presumptive COVID, I downsized my plans to not include react and not include mixed doubles.
